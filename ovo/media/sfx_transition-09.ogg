<h2>Real Estate Financing Calculators</h2>
<p><img src="https://www.mortgagecalculator.org/images/calculating-and-saving-for-mortgage-payments.png" width="1300" height="800" alt="Calculating Home Payments and Saving Up a Down Payment."></p>
    
	<a href='https://www.mortgagecalculator.org/calculators/mortgage-payment-calculator.php'><h3>Mortgage Payment Calculator</h3></a>
	<p>This tool allows you to calculate your monthly home loan payments, using various loan terms, interest rates, and loan amounts. It includes advanced features like amortization tables and the ability to calculate a loan including property taxes, homeowners insurance &amp; property mortgage insurance.</p><br />

	<a href='https://www.mortgagecalculator.org/calculators/buy-vs-rent-calculator.php'><h3>Rent vs Buy Calculator</h3></a>
	<p>Are you still renting and considering buying your home?<br /><br /> Use this free online calculator to compare the financial costs and benefits of each option.</p><br />

	<a href='https://www.mortgagecalculator.org/calculators/mortgage-principal-calculator.php'><h3>Remaining Home Loan Balance Calculator</h3></a>
	<p>Want to see how fast you will pay off your home loan? Use this free calculator to figure out what your remaining principal balance &amp; home equity will be after paying on your loan for a specific number of months or years.<br /><br /><strong>Want to Build Equity Faster?</strong> <br /> If you want to add extra payments to your loan to pay it off quicker, please use <a href="https://www.mortgagecalculator.org/calculators/mortgage-length-calculator.php">this calculator</a> to see how quickly you will pay off your loan by making additional payments.</p><br />

	<a href='https://www.mortgagecalculator.org/calcs/how-much-home-can-i-afford.php'><h3>How Much Home Can I Afford?</h3></a>
	<p>This tool uses your current monthly rent payment to estimate how much loan you can afford while spending the same amount each month. We also offer a  <a href="https://www.mortgagecalculator.org/calcs/qualification.php">loan qualifier tool</a> which highlights maximum loan affordability based  on the buyer's income &amp; a tool to compare the <a href="https://www.mortgagecalculator.org/calcs/renting-vs-buying.php">financial benefits of renting or buying</a>.</p><br />
		
	<a href='https://www.mortgagecalculator.org/calcs/downpayment.php'><h3>Down Payment</h3></a>
	<p>Quickly estimate the down payment needed to meet a monthly budget, or use our <a href="https://www.mortgagecalculator.org/calcs/downpayment-savings.php">down payment savings goal planner</a> to figure out how long it will take you to reach a desired down payment.</p><br />

	<a href='https://www.mortgagecalculator.org/calculators/mortgage-length-calculator.php'><h3>Loan Payoff Date Estimator</h3></a>
	<p>Have more money to put down on your home loan? Insert the amount you would like to pay each month &amp; this calculator will figure how many years you save on your home loan given that additional payment versus a loan set to amortize over the initial specified loan period. <br /><br /><strong>Enter Your Principal &amp; Interest Payments</strong><br /> Please note this calculator only uses the principal and interest (P&amp;I) portion of your mortgage payment. If you include property taxes, HOA fees, PMI or other expenses in your loan payment then you will have to subtract those out when using this calculator. For example, if an all-in PITA mortgage payment is $2,000 but only $1,500 of that amount goes to P&amp;I and you want to add an extra $300 monthly to your payments then you would put $1,800 in the monthly payment box below. <br /><br /><strong>Making Extra Payments Starting a Few Years In</strong><br /> If you are already a couple years into your loan and are just beginning to make extra payments then you can adjust the loan amount to whatever your current balance is &amp; set the loan term to how many years you have remaining in the original loan term. So if you were 2.5 years in to a 30-year loan and your balance on a $250,000 loan was $218,600 then you would enter $218,600 as the loan amount and 27.5 years as the loan term. If you are uncertain what your balance is you can use <a href="https://www.mortgagecalculator.org/calculators/mortgage-principal-calculator.php">this calculator</a> to see your current balance.</p><br />

	<a href='https://www.mortgagecalculator.org/calculators/what-if-i-pay-more-calculator.php'><h3>Extra Payment Calculator</h3></a>
	<p><strong>Start Paying More Early &amp; Save Big</strong><br/>Want to build your home equity quicker? Use this free calculator to see how even small extra payments will save you years of payments and thousands of Dollars of additional interest cost. Making extra payments early in the loan saves you much more money over the life of the loan as the extinguised principal is no longer accruing interest for the remainder of the loan. The earlier you begin paying extra the more money you'll save.<br /><br />
<strong>Making Extra Payments In the Middle of the Loan Term</strong><br />
If you start making extra payments in the middle of your loan then enter the current loan balance when you started making extra payments and set the loan term for however long you have left in the loan. For example, if you are 3.5 years into a 30-year home loan, you would set the loan term to 26.5 years and you would set the loan balance to whatever amount is shown on your statement. If you do not have a statement to see the current balance you can <a href="https://www.mortgagecalculator.org/calculators/mortgage-principal-calculator.php">calculate the current balance</a> so long as you know when the loan began, how much the loan was for &amp; your rate of interest.<br /><br />
<strong>More Advanced Calculations?</strong><br />
This calculator allows you to enter an initial extra payment along with extra monthly payments which coincide with your regular monthly payments. If you want to make irregular extra contributions or contributions which have a different periodicity than your regular payments please see our <a href="https://www.mortgagecalculator.org/calculators/standard-vs-bi-weekly-calculator.php">bi-weekly mortgage calculator</a> (if you are using biweekly payments to make an effective 13th monthly payment) or our <a href="https://www.mortgagecalculator.org/additional-payment-calculator/">advanced additional mortgage payments calculator</a> which allows you to make multiple concurrent extra payments with varying frequencies.</p><br />

	<a href='https://www.mortgagecalculator.org/additional-payment-calculator/'><h3>Advanced Extra Payment Calculator</h3></a>
	<p>This calculator is similar to the above calculator except it allows you to add a broad range of extra payment types. For example, you could combine an extra weekly payment of $25 for 3 years and then switch over to an extra monthly payment of $150 for 2 years. Or you could do both at the same time along with various one-time payments. If your extra payments will be continuous until the loan is paid off &amp; you intend to make them monthly then you can use <a href="https://www.mortgagecalculator.org/calcs/mortgage-payoff.php">this payoff calculator</a> which includes a graphical layout.</p><br />

	<a href='https://www.mortgagecalculator.org/calculators/payment-per-thousand-calculator.php'><h3>Monthly Interest + Principal Cost Per Thousand</h3></a>
	<p>This calculator shows how much you pay each month, each year &amp; throughout the duration of the loan &mdash; for each $1,000 of mortgage financing.</p><br />		

	<a href='https://www.mortgagecalculator.org/calculators/what-is-the-real-apr-calculator.php'><h3>Calculate Real APR</h3></a>
	<p>Advertised vs actual home loan interest costs may vary singificantly based on points, origination fees &amp; closing costs. Use this tool to estimate your real mortgage APR (Annual Percentage Rate) inclusive of these other mortgage expenses.</p><br />

	<a href='https://www.mortgagecalculator.org/calculators/affordability-calculator.php'><h3>Mortgage Affordability</h3></a>
	<p><strong>Estimate Home Value &amp; Monthly Mortgage Payments Based on DTI Ratios</strong> <br />Unsure how much you can afford to spend on a house? Use this calculator to figure home loan affordability from the lender's point of view. A table on this page shows how <a href="https://www.mortgagecalculator.org/calculators/affordability-calculator.php#loantypes">different home loan programs have different front-end and back-end ratio requirements</a>.<br /><br /> <strong>Can vs Should</strong><br />The results of this calculator can offer a rough idea of max loan qualification, however for most people it is better not to get close to their max so they have a financial cushion in case of a down turn. Those who are seeking investment returns will usually obtain higher returns in the stock market &amp; stock investments are much more liquid &amp; easier to sell than homes.</p><br />

	<a href='https://www.mortgagecalculator.org/calculators/tax-benefits-calculator.php'><h3>Interest Tax Deduction Estimator</h3></a>
	<p>One of the advantages of real estate investment is that some homeowners may qualify to deduct mortgage interest payments from their income when filing their taxes.

	<a href='https://www.mortgagecalculator.org/calculators/interest-only-calculator.php'><h3>Interest-Only Calculator</h3></a>
	<p>This tool helps buyers calculate current interest-only payments, but most interest-only loans are adjustable rate mortgages (ARMs). When the housing market is hot many people chase it, buying near the peak with interest-only loans. If home prices continue to climb, one can refinance at a lower rate. However if rates reset higher, so too will payments &mdash; causing home prices to decline &amp; many marginal buyers to lose their equity &amp; perhaps their homes.</p><br />

	<a href='https://www.mortgagecalculator.org/calculators/interest-only--with-repayments-calculator.php'><h3>Interest-Only Loan With Additional Payments</h3></a>
	<p>One problem with interest-only loans is that unless home prices rise the homeowner does not build any equity in their house, which puts them in a precarious position when mortgage rates rise. One way to build a bit of a buffer from market fluctuations is by adding extra payments applied toward your principal.</p><br />

For each quote you can select different rates, terms, points, origination fees &amp; closing costs. 15-year loans build home equity faster, whereas 30-year mortgages offer lower monthly payments.</p><br />

	<a href='https://www.mortgagecalculator.org/calculators/standard-vs-bi-weekly-calculator.php'><h3>Bi-Weekly Mortgage Payments</h3></a>
	<p>In the early years of a longterm loan, most of the payment is applied toward interest. Home buyers can shave years off their loan by paying bi-weekly &amp; making extra payments. Bi-weekly payments help you pay off principal in an accelerated fashion &mdash; before interest has a chance to compound on it. In making biweekly payments, those 26 annual payments effectively create an additional (13th) month of regular payments in each calendar year.</p><br />

Many credit cards not only charge interest on their fees, but also charge higher rates of interest for anyone who misses a payment. Repeated missed payments can lead to near usurious interest rates. <br/><br/>If you have significant credit card debt &amp; pay extra each month, you can really eat into principal and save thousands of Dollars in interest costs. If the debts are reasonable, it may also make sense to pay off credit cards &amp; other high interest loans using a home equity loan. If the debt load is too high you may want to talk to a credit counselor to seek alternative options.</p><br />
